sinatra-heroku-skeleton
=======================

Quick skeleton file for getting Sinatra apps on Heroku.

I love [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) for trivial web apps. I am quite partial to [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/) as I don't have to mess with any config files to get an app online. Combine these two and you have quite a potent tool to get stuff done without much fuss. 

	-  git clone https://github.com/swmcc/sinatra-heroku-skeleton.git ./
	
	-  bundle install

	-  heroku create

	-  git push heroku master

Of course this assumes you Heroku setup on your machine already.
